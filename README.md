Abstract
--------

This work quantifies the reactivity impact of 53 impurities within the primary coolant for thermal spectrum Fluoride-Salt Cooled High-Temperature Reactors (FHR).
It does so, not by assuming a mixture of impurities, but by individually assessing the impact of each impurity per amount present -- so called "specific reactivity worths".
Two approaches are taken to making these estimates, one using the new KSEN tool in MCNP6.1 and a more traditional one using spectrum-collapsed absorption cross-sections.
The KSEN tool is shown to be very effective at this procedure.
The utility of these specific reactivity worths is demonstrated by estimating the impact of flibe impurities upon the coolant temperature coefficient of reactivity, the system excess reactivity, and the achievable discharge burnup for an example FHR.
Some discussion is also provided on the available detection and removal techniques for important impurities.
